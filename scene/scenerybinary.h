// Binary, modular scenery container ("eu7" format).
//
// Replaces the legacy text formats (.scn / .scm / .inc / .ctr) and the old terrain-only
// .sbt blob. The mapping is one-to-one and modular: every text file compiles to exactly
// one binary twin and includes are preserved as references, so the binary twin of one
// file points to the binary twins of the files it includes.
//     route.scn -> route.scnb     piece.inc -> piece.incb
//     mesh.scm  -> mesh.scmb       events.ctr -> events.ctrb
//
// A twin stores the source file's own, fully resolved content (comments stripped,
// parameters/random sets resolved) as an ordered list of entries:
//   * string tokens (keywords like "node"/"endmodel", names, paths) are interned into a
//     per-file table and referenced by a varint index, so a keyword that occurs
//     thousands of times is stored once;
//   * numeric tokens are stored typed -- integral values as a zig-zag varint (1-2 bytes
//     for the many small ints), fractional values as an 8-byte IEEE double;
//   * an "include" entry carries the (interned) filename expression and parameters.
// Each entry's type is packed into the low bits of a single varint together with the
// token index, so the common case (a token) costs just that one varint.
//
// Reading is buffer-based and streaming: the whole twin is read into memory once and
// parsed by pointer (no per-byte stream calls), and entries are decoded on demand
// (no intermediate materialisation), with string tokens served as views into the
// buffer. The binary is consumed transparently at the cParser file layer; the scenery
// deserializer is unaware of the format. cParser::Name(), per-.inc node grouping and
// parameter substitution are preserved exactly as in the text path.

namespace scene {

// "eu7" + format version, little-endian via MAKE_ID4 ('e','u','7',<ver>).
// v4: buffer-streamed reader, packed entry tags, zig-zag varint integers.
// v5: tokens stored in original case (lower-cased per consumer at replay) with a quoted
//     flag, so baking is grammar-independent (enables the headless/standalone baker).
// v6: top-level nodes wrapped in a marker carrying their class (infrastructure/visual)
//     and byte span, so the reader can serve or skip a whole node per load pass
//     (enables progressive loading: infrastructure eager, visuals deferred).
// v7: a visual model node's marker also carries the model's local position (3 f32), so the
//     camera-ring visual load can distance-test and skip a node in O(1) without reading any
//     of its tokens -- the difference between scanning 1M flora nodes per ring and not.
// v8: fixes the eventlauncher node terminator (it ends with "end", not "endevent"); twins
//     baked before this had an over-long eventlauncher span that, when the node was skipped
//     in the visual pass, swallowed the following endorigin -> the origin stack accumulated
//     and flung terrain/models across the map. bumping invalidates those bad twins.
// bumping the version invalidates older twins so they are recompiled rather than misread.
